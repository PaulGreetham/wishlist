# WishList App

## Shopping Wish list

A wish list app that allows users to:

1. add an item
2. mark an item as 'done'
3. toggle between 'done' and 'not done'
4. delete the item



In this exercise your task is to create a simple shopping wish list app - no backend required.
Exactly how you implement and design this is up to you - but your solution should be implemented in the files `index.html`, `wishlist.ts` (that gets transpiled to `/dist/wishlist.js`) and `style/wishlist.css` in the `src` folder. You may use the screenshot at the bottom of this page as inspiration.




### Technical information

- the shopping wish list is in a state object and _NOT_ in the DOM, which renders the view based on the state.
- uses Semantic html elements.
- uses a clear naming strategy for css and class names.
- uses BEM.
- is made with a mobile first approach.
- persists the state in [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
