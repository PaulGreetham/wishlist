# Shopping WishList App

## About

I created a shopping wishlist app that enables the user to add an item by add a 'title' and 'description' and clicking the 'add to wishlist' button. This then creates a new item card that can be toggled to either 'done' or 'not done' as well as deleted when 'done'. When the card is 'done' it is visually different and can be easily identifed. A new card item is added to the top of the list; when toggled done, it goes to the bottom of the list.

### Technical information

- the shopping wish list is in a state object and _NOT_ in the DOM, which renders the view based on the state
- uses Semantic html elements
- uses a clear naming strategy for css and class names
- uses BEM
- is made with a mobile first approach


### Project Aims

I created this project to:
- use state management to control the UI
- experiment with CSS transition and box shadow (on hover) to create a dynamic feel
- use the cool teal/purple color palate combo
- practice responsive design
- use Netlify to deploy directly from GitHub pushes
